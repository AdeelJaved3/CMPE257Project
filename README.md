# Cyberbullying Detection System
## This project uses the support vector machine, XGBoost and transformer machine learning architectures to detect tweets that contain different forms of cyberbullying.

The purpose of this project is to preprocess data and then use the processed data to train several machine learning models. The data contains over 47,000 tweets, in tabular form, provided from Kaggle and a scholarly article. One of the main objectives is to reproduce and outperform models on the same dataset found in this scholarly article <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04088">The Use of a Large Language Model for Cyberbullying Detection</a>. 
The best performing model is used in a small web application to demonstrate the effectiveness in classifying cyberbullying text.
